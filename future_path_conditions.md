# KinCart — Research path and hypothetical future conditions

## Research status (now)
KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact in the HCI/CSCW space. The current work focuses on:
- domain language and interaction contracts that reduce mental load
- emotionally safe coordination design (visibility without enforcement)
- failure-mode-aware design (preventing trust breaches under breakdowns)
- prototype-based evaluation (Figma + walkthrough video)

This repository is maintained as a research record. It does not operate as a product or service.

## Research goals (near-term)
- Refine 2–3 research questions and a feasible qualitative study plan
- Produce a supervisor-ready packet: 1-page contribution, 2-page statement, writing sample, prototype evidence
- Conduct early-stage studies under appropriate ethics processes (as required by host institution)

## What is explicitly out of scope (while research-only)
- charging money, offering a service, or “running a business”
- User acquisition, growth targets, “retention” KPIs, or operational management
- publishing paste-ready implementation recipes (schemas/RLS/RPC specifics)

## Hypothetical future pathway (conditions only; not a plan)
If KinCart were ever to move beyond research-only status, all of the following would need to be true first:
1) Institutional approval and supervisor alignment on scope and ethics posture
2) Legal and regulatory compliance appropriate to the country of residence (including non-commercial status)
3) Data governance and participant safety framework validated (especially identity/exit safety)
4) Funding source aligned with non-coercive, ethically sound research-to-practice transition
5) A public communication policy that avoids pressure, enforcement framing, and implementation disclosure

Until these conditions are satisfied, KinCart remains research-only.
