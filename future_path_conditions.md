# KinCart — Research Path and Hypothetical Future Conditions

## Research Status (Now)

KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact in HCI/CSCW. The current work focuses on:

- Domain Language and interaction contracts that reduce mental load.
- Emotionally safe coordination design (visibility without enforcement).
- Failure-mode-aware design (preventing trust breaches under breakdown and repair).
- Prototype-as-probe materials for interpretive work (Figma prototype and walkthrough video used in interpretive walkthrough interviews).

This repository is maintained as a research record. It does not operate as a product or service. Activity is treated as a readable record of shared intent, not a performance feed.

## Research Goals (Near-Term)

- Refine 2–3 research questions and a feasible qualitative study plan.
- Produce a supervisor-ready packet: one-page contribution, two-page statement, writing sample, and prototype materials (as research materials, not findings).
- Conduct early-stage studies under appropriate ethics processes (as required by the host institution).

## What is Explicitly Out of Scope (While Research-Only)

- Charging money, offering a service, or “running a business”.
- User acquisition, growth targets, retention KPIs, performance metrics, or operational management.
- Publishing paste-ready implementation recipes (schemas/RLS/RPC specifics).

## Hypothetical Future Conditions (Not a Plan)

If KinCart were ever to move beyond research-only status, all of the following would need to be true first:

1) Institutional approval and supervisor alignment on scope, ethics posture, and participant protections.
2) Legal and regulatory compliance appropriate to the country of residence, including preservation of non-commercial research status where relevant.
3) Data governance and participant safety framework validated, especially identity safety and exit safety.
4) Funding source aligned with non-coercive, ethically sound research-to-practice transition.
5) A public communication policy that avoids pressure, enforcement framing, and implementation disclosure.

Until these conditions are satisfied, KinCart remains research-only.
