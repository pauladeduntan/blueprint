# Compatibility Layer (Funding Theme Translation, Without Topic Pivot)

This note translates the KinCart research spine into common funding themes without changing the core topic. It is not a claim that KinCart is a health, security, or public services system. The spine remains household coordination in HCI/CSCW.

## Core Spine (Unchanged)

Household coordination as a CSCW site for studying how shared intent can be made visible without enforcement drift, with attention to interpretation, breakdown, repair, trust, boundary integrity, and emotional safety. High-Stakes Handoff Items are used as stress surfaces to amplify these dynamics without introducing reminders, nudges, scoring, or urgency mechanics.

## What Stays Locked

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation.
- Visibility Over Reminders.
- No contribution scoring, fairness evaluation, or per-person judgement.
- Reversibility by default.
- System-owned language and system-owned identity display.
- Exit safety and boundary integrity treated as safety properties.
- Prototypes as probes, not evaluation targets.
- Qualitative, interpretive CSCW methods only.

## Theme Translation (Why this can Fit Funded Calls)

### Digital Health and Care Coordination

Households are often care-adjacent coordination networks where appointments, pickups, and responsibilities are negotiated rather than assigned. The KinCart focus on High-Stakes Handoff Items, identity safety, and breakdown and repair provides a transferable lens for studying emotionally safe visibility in care-adjacent coordination without turning logs into surveillance or compliance tools.

### Human-Centred Security and Privacy

The work treats boundary integrity and exit safety as trust contracts, not just access control. Wrong-context actions, identity exposure after exit, and log interpretability are framed as relational harms with disproportionate impact. This supports human-centred security inquiry into how safety properties are perceived, misread, and repaired in everyday shared systems.

### Digital Public Services and Administrative Harm

Wrong-context actions and identity exposure have analogues in administrative harm: mis-routing, inadvertent disclosure, and systems that appear to “take sides.” KinCart’s constraint-first approach provides a way to study how interface cues shape perceived judgement, safety, and trust during breakdowns in shared-access contexts.

## How to Use this Layer (for Applications)

- Use it to explain relevance when a funded call is theme-framed (health, security, public services) but method-compatible with interpretive CSCW.
- Do not rename the topic to match a theme. Instead, state that domestic coordination is the primary site and the theme is an analogue for broader small-group coordination harms.
- Keep refusals explicit: no reminders, no scoring, no nudges, no urgency mechanics.

## What Can Vary without Changing the Spine

- Recruitment channel and vignette framing (household, care-adjacent household moments, shared-access boundary scenarios).
- Examples used to motivate harms (handoff, boundary breach, identity exposure).
- The specific breakdown scenarios used in interpretive sessions, while preserving the same invariants.
