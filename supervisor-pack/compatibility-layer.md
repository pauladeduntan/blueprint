# Compatibility Layer (Funding Theme Translation, Without Topic Pivot)

This note translates the KinCart research spine into common funding themes without changing the core topic. It is not a claim that KinCart is a health, security, or public services system. The spine remains Household coordination in HCI/CSCW.

## Core Spine (Unchanged)

Household coordination as a CSCW site for studying how shared intent can be made visible without enforcement drift, with attention to interpretation, breakdown, repair, trust, boundary integrity, and emotional safety. High-Stakes Handoff Items are used as stress surfaces to amplify these dynamics without introducing reminders, nudges, scoring, or urgency mechanics.

Transferability is in the harm model and interpretive method (how cues are read under breakdown), not in rebranding the domain.

## What Stays Locked

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation.
- Visibility Over Reminders.
- No contribution scoring, fairness evaluation, or per-person judgement.
- Reversibility by default.
- System-owned language and system-owned identity display.
- Exit safety and boundary integrity treated as safety properties.
- Activity is not a performance feed or notification centre. Attribution may exist for active Members, but must not be amplified (no per-person views, counts, sorting, grouping, filtering), and identity must dynamically redact to “Former Member” after membership ends.
- Prototypes as probes, not evaluation targets.
- Qualitative, interpretive CSCW methods only.

## Theme Translation (Why this Can Fit Funded Calls)

### Care-Adjacent Coordination (Without Rebranding As Health)

Households are often care-adjacent coordination networks where appointments, pickups, and responsibilities are negotiated rather than assigned. The KinCart focus on High-Stakes Handoff Items, identity safety, and breakdown and repair provides a transferable lens for studying emotionally safe visibility in care-adjacent coordination without turning logs into surveillance or compliance tools.

### Human-Centred Security and Privacy

The work treats boundary integrity and exit safety as trust contracts, not just access control. Wrong-context actions, identity exposure after exit, and log interpretability are framed as relational harms with disproportionate impact. This supports human-centred security inquiry into how safety properties are perceived, misread, and repaired in everyday shared systems.

### Digital Public Services and Administrative Harm

Wrong-context actions and identity exposure have analogues in administrative harm: mis-routing, inadvertent disclosure, and systems that appear to “take sides.” KinCart’s constraint-first approach provides a way to study how interface cues shape perceived judgement, safety, and trust during breakdowns in shared-access contexts.

## How To Use This Layer (For Applications)

- Use it to explain relevance when a funded call is theme-framed (care-adjacent coordination, security, public services) but method-compatible with interpretive CSCW.
- Do not rename the topic to match a theme. Instead, state that domestic coordination is the primary site and the theme is an analogue for broader small-group coordination harms.
- Keep refusals explicit: no reminders, no scoring, no nudges, no urgency mechanics.

## What Can Vary Without Changing the Spine

- Recruitment channel and vignette framing (Household, care-adjacent Household moments, shared-access boundary scenarios).
- Examples used to motivate harms (Handoff Item, boundary breach, identity exposure).
- The specific breakdown scenarios used in interpretive sessions, while preserving the same invariants.
