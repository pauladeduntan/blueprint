# Analogue Contexts (Public-Safe, Non-Commitment)

Households are the primary empirical site for KinCart. Other contexts are referenced only as analogues to clarify why household coordination is a valid CSCW site, not as an expansion plan.

## Why Analogues Appear at all

KinCart examines **visibility-to-enforcement drift** and related relational harms (blame amplification, surveillance interpretations, wrong-boundary actions, identity exposure after exit). These harms can arise in other shared-access coordination settings, but this repository does not claim cross-domain applicability or multi-site scope.

## What Stays Unchanged

- The primary site remains Household coordination.
- Methods remain qualitative, interpretive CSCW.
- Prototypes remain probes, not evaluation targets.
- No reminders, nudges, scoring, urgency cues, or enforcement framing.
- Contribution is framed as mapping how representation choices shape moral interpretations (pressure, blame risk, trust, repair) under breakdown.

## Examples of Analogues (Illustrative Only)

- Shared-access contexts where wrong-boundary actions can be read as “taking sides”.
- Contexts where logs can be misread as surveillance even without explicit scoring.
- Contexts where exit safety and identity rendering shape perceived safety after relationship changes.
