Shared-Intent Coordination In Households: Making Visibility Safe Without Enforcement

## Problem

In shared households, coordination tools can reduce ambiguity but often increase emotional load by introducing accountability cues such as nudges, reminders, “overdue” states, or performance-like feeds. These cues can shift coordination from shared intent toward perceived management, increasing friction and risking trust breakdown, particularly in situations where coordination is informal and authority is weak.

These risks are amplified in High-Stakes coordination moments, such as Handoff Items involving appointments, care, or time-sensitive coordination. In such cases, mistakes are socially costly, and visibility can quickly become blame if not carefully constrained.

## Core Idea

KinCart investigates a constraint-first alternative: making shared intent visible while preserving emotional safety. It is intentionally not a task manager and avoids enforcement mechanics. Handoff Item scenarios are included deliberately as High-Stakes coordination probes where pressure, interpretation risk, and breakdown are more likely to surface.

## Research Contributions

1) Constraint-first framework for household coordination systems, defined by explicit invariants:
   - Emotional Safety Over Optimisation  
   - Visibility Over Reminders  
   - Reversibility By Default  
   - System-Owned Language (No Blame Or Policing)

2) Domain language as a safety mechanism that prevents scorekeeping and attribution drift (for example, “Completed,” “Save Progress,” “Former Member”), treating labels as coordination cues rather than neutral copy.

3) Failure-aware interaction contracts that surface high-risk breakdowns during High-Stakes handoffs and make them legible for qualitative study (for example, wrong-household actions; identity exposure after leaving or removal).

4) Decision discipline as method: explicit decision records and anti-drift gates that keep research materials conceptually consistent over time while intentionally avoiding implementation recipes.
