## Research Statement — PhD In HCI / CSCW


## 1. Research Problem and Motivation

In shared Households, coordination tools can reduce ambiguity but often increase emotional load by introducing accountability cues such as nudges, reminders, “overdue” states, and performance-like feeds. These cues can shift coordination from shared intent toward perceived management, increasing friction and risking trust breakdown, especially where authority is informal and negotiated rather than formal.

My research examines this drift as an interaction and interpretation problem in HCI/CSCW: how seemingly small interface cues become social signals of obligation, blame, and surveillance. I focus on moments of breakdown and repair, where mistakes are costly and coordination artefacts can either support relational recovery or amplify conflict.

These risks are amplified in High-Stakes coordination moments, such as Handoff Items involving appointments, care, or time-bound coordination. In such cases, visibility can quickly become blame if not carefully constrained. High-Stakes does not justify enforcement or urgency mechanics. It increases the need for emotionally safe visibility.

## 2. Conceptual Contribution to HCI/CSCW

This work contributes a constraint-first account of household coordination systems that preserve emotional safety while making shared intent visible. The contribution is not a new feature set, but a research-grounded vocabulary of interaction contracts and guardrails that prevent enforcement drift.

Key conceptual contributions include:

- Visibility Without Enforcement: Activity as a readable record of shared intent, not a performance feed, and not a notification centre.
- System-owned Language as Safety Infrastructure: labels that reduce attribution pressure and blame risk (Member, Former Member, Complete Item, Hide Item, Save Progress).
- Reversibility as Repair Support: interaction contracts that prevent “I ruined it” moments and make recovery socially easier.
- Boundary Integrity And Exit Safety As Trust Contracts: Household boundaries and membership transitions treated as safety-critical, not merely state changes.
- High-Stakes Handoff Items as a Methodological Stress Surface: deliberate scenarios used to surface interpretation risk, breakdown, and repair dynamics under heightened relational stakes.

## 3. Empirical Strategy and Methodological Orientation

Methodologically, I use qualitative, interpretive CSCW approaches focused on meaning-making, breakdown, and repair. I treat prototypes as probes, not evaluation targets, and I explicitly avoid behavioural measurement, scoring, or optimisation claims.

My empirical strategy combines:

- Interpretive Walkthrough Interviews: participants interpret a prototype-as-probe through guided scenarios to surface how cues are read as pressure, safety, blame, or support.
- Vignette-Based Interpretive Sessions: structured breakdown scenarios (wrong-Household action, ambiguous completion, identity exposure after exit), including High-Stakes Handoff Item moments.
- Optional Diary Prompts with Follow-up Interviews: lightweight prompts to capture lived coordination moments, treated as interpretive material rather than behavioural telemetry.

What the system explicitly refuses to do (no reminders, no nudges, no contribution scoring, no urgency mechanics) is treated as part of the method: these refusals clarify the boundary between visibility and enforcement and make interpretation shifts legible.

## 4. Research Trajectory and Fit with HCI/CSCW

Household coordination provides a grounded site for studying shared intent, negotiated responsibility, and emotionally safe visibility. The work generalises to broader CSCW concerns about shared logs, shared access, identity display, boundary integrity, and how coordination artefacts drift into surveillance or management cues.

HCI/CSCW provides the appropriate intellectual home because it foregrounds interactional interpretation, socio-technical breakdown and repair, and the consequences of design cues in everyday life. I am open to refining the research questions and study design in dialogue with supervisors, while keeping the core invariants stable: emotional safety over optimisation, and visibility over reminders.
