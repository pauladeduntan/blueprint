## 1. Research Problem and Motivation

Many everyday coordination systems rely on digital artefacts to make shared intent visible, reduce ambiguity, and help people align their actions. In domestic and shared-living contexts, however, these same systems often produce unintended social side effects. Features meant to increase clarit, such as reminders, completion states, attribution cues, or activity feeds can gradually shift coordination from shared awareness into perceived enforcement, judgement, or surveillance. When this happens, emotional load increases, interpersonal tension rises, and trust becomes fragile, especially in settings where coordination is shared but authority is informal or absent.

My research examines how people interpret coordination cues in everyday household settings, with particular attention to **high-stakes coordination moments such as handoffs involving appointments, care, or time-sensitive responsibility**. I am interested in how seemingly neutral interface decisions come to feel pressuring, conflict-inducing, or discouraging under these conditions, and how people respond when coordination tools begin to feel like they are “managing” them rather than supporting shared intent. Rather than framing these outcomes as usability problems or adoption failures, I treat them as interpretive breakdowns that emerge when coordination artefacts drift away from emotionally safe visibility.

Households provide a particularly revealing site for studying these dynamics. Roles are negotiated rather than assigned, mistakes are socially costly, and **handoff failures**, such as missed appointments, forgotten pickups, or unfulfilled care responsibilities carry immediate relational consequences. These conditions make domestic settings a natural environment for observing breakdown, repair, and trust under pressure, without the formal hierarchies or enforcement structures that often obscure such processes in organisational contexts.


## 2. Research Contribution

This work contributes to HCI and CSCW by developing a **constraint-first approach to coordination systems**, centred on preserving emotional safety while maintaining visibility. Instead of optimising for task completion or accountability, constraints are treated as research instruments that shape how coordination cues are read, felt, and acted upon.

A central contribution is the concept of **repairable coordination**. Coordination actions are designed to be reversible, legible, and non-punitive, so that everyday mistakes do not escalate into blame or conflict. By foregrounding reversibility, system-owned language, and non-destructive state changes, the research examines how people recover from breakdowns and how trust is sustained after missteps.

A second contribution focuses on **domain language as an interactional safety mechanism**. System-owned labels and neutral phrasing, such as “completed,” “save progress,” or “former member” are treated not as copy choices, but as coordination cues that actively shape how judgement, responsibility, and legitimacy are perceived.

A key contribution of this work is the explicit use of **handoff scenarios as a high-stakes coordination probe**. Handoffs concentrate responsibility, timing, and interpersonal risk, making interpretive drift, blame attribution, and breakdown more likely. By studying how coordination cues are interpreted during handoffs, the research surfaces pressures that often remain latent in lower-stakes list coordination.

Finally, the work advances a **failure-aware perspective on coordination artefacts**. High-risk moments including handoffs, wrong-context actions, membership changes, and visibility after exit are designed to remain visible and interpretable rather than hidden or optimised away. These moments become central sites for understanding breakdown and repair where emotional and relational stakes are highest.


## 3. Empirical Strategy and Methodological Orientation

Methodologically, I adopt an interpretive, qualitative approach consistent with CSCW traditions. Research prototypes are used as empirical probes rather than evaluation targets. Their purpose is not to measure efficiency or success, but to surface how people make sense of coordination cues during everyday use, breakdown, and repair.

Planned methods include prototype walkthrough interviews focused on interpretation rather than task performance, with **handoff scenarios used deliberately to surface pressure, blame risk, and repair strategies**. These are complemented by short diary studies capturing lived coordination breakdowns and scenario-based discussions that explore how alternative constraints reshape interpretation.

Equally important are the things the system explicitly refuses to do. The absence of reminders, scoring, attribution pressure, or urgency cues is treated as part of the research design itself. These refusals make alternative coordination logics visible and analytically meaningful, particularly under high-stakes handoff conditions where enforcement would otherwise be most tempting.


## 4. Research Trajectory and Fit

While household coordination is the initial empirical focus, the broader research trajectory concerns shared-access systems and everyday coordination contexts where authority is weak, participation is voluntary, and **high-stakes handoffs or responsibility transfers** introduce pressure that coordination technologies must handle without coercion. These questions extend to other CSCW domains, including family technologies, shared digital artefacts, collaborative tools, and values-aware interaction design.

HCI and CSCW provide the appropriate intellectual home for this work because of their emphasis on situated use, interpretive analysis, and the social consequences of interface decisions. I am seeking doctoral supervision in an environment that values domestic and everyday computing, coordination and collaboration research, and ethical, safety-aware design.

I view this research as an evolving programme rather than a fixed project, and I am open to refining research questions and methods in dialogue with supervisors while preserving a core commitment to **non-coercive, emotionally safe coordination systems**, particularly in high-stakes handoff situations where breakdowns matter most.
