Research Statement — PhD in HCI / CSCW

Applicant: Paul Adesumbo Adeduntan


1. Research problem and motivation

Everyday coordination systems increasingly rely on digital artefacts to make shared intent visible, reduce ambiguity, and align action. In domestic and shared-living contexts, however, these systems often introduce unintended social side effects. Features designed to improve visibility—such as reminders, completion states, attribution cues, and activity feeds—can shift coordination from shared awareness into perceived enforcement, judgement, or surveillance. This shift increases emotional load, interpersonal tension, and the risk of trust breakdown, particularly where coordination is shared but authority is informal or absent.

My research investigates how interface-level coordination cues are interpreted in everyday household settings, and how seemingly neutral design choices can produce pressure, conflict, or withdrawal. Rather than treating these outcomes as usability failures or adoption problems, I approach them as interpretive breakdowns that emerge when coordination artefacts drift from supporting shared intent to implicitly managing people.

Domestic coordination provides a productive research site because it foregrounds these tensions clearly: roles are negotiated rather than assigned, mistakes are socially costly, and exit or disengagement carries relational consequences. Studying households allows me to examine coordination, breakdown, and repair without the formal hierarchies or enforcement mechanisms that mask these dynamics in organisational settings.


2. Research contribution

My work contributes to HCI and CSCW by articulating a constraint-first approach to coordination system design, centred on preserving emotional safety while maintaining visibility. Rather than optimising for task completion or accountability, this approach treats constraints as research instruments that shape how coordination cues are interpreted.

A central contribution is the concept of repairable coordination: designing coordination actions to be reversible, legible, and non-punitive so that mistakes do not escalate into blame or conflict. By foregrounding reversibility, system-owned language, and non-destructive state changes, the research examines how participants recover from breakdowns and how trust is maintained after missteps.

A second contribution lies in the use of domain language as an interactional safety mechanism. System-owned labels and neutral phrasing (for example, “completed,” “save progress,” or “former member”) are treated not as copy choices but as coordination cues that actively shape perceived judgement, responsibility, and legitimacy.

Finally, the work advances a failure-aware perspective on coordination artefacts, explicitly designing for high-risk moments such as wrong-context actions, membership changes, and visibility after exit. These moments are made legible for study rather than hidden or optimised away.


3. Empirical strategy and methodological orientation

Methodologically, I adopt an interpretive, qualitative approach consistent with CSCW traditions. I treat research prototypes as empirical probes rather than evaluation targets. Their purpose is not to measure efficiency or success, but to surface how people interpret coordination cues during everyday use, breakdown, and repair.

Planned methods include prototype walkthrough interviews focused on interpretation rather than task performance, short diary studies capturing lived coordination breakdowns, and scenario-based discussions that explore alternative design constraints. Analysis is oriented toward how participants read system signals, when visibility becomes pressure, and how trust is negotiated after mistakes.

Importantly, what the system explicitly refuses to do—such as issuing reminders, scoring contributions, or foregrounding attribution—is treated as part of the research design. These absences make alternative coordination logics observable and analytically productive.


4. Research trajectory and fit

While household coordination serves as the initial empirical focus, the broader research trajectory concerns shared-access systems and everyday coordination contexts where authority is weak, participation is voluntary, and relational safety matters. These questions extend to other CSCW domains, including shared digital artefacts, family technologies, collaborative tools, and values-aware interaction design.

HCI and CSCW provide the appropriate intellectual home for this work because of their emphasis on situated use, interpretive analysis, and the social consequences of interface decisions. I am seeking doctoral supervision in an environment that values domestic and everyday computing, coordination and collaboration research, and ethical, safety-aware design.

I view this research as an evolving program rather than a fixed project, and I am open to refining research questions and methods in dialogue with supervisors while preserving the core commitment to non-coercive, emotionally safe coordination systems.
