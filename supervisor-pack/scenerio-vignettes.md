# Scenario Vignettes

## Purpose

These vignettes are prompts for qualitative, interpretive discussion. They are designed to surface how participants interpret system cues, where breakdown occurs, and what repair feels safe.

They are not benchmarks, tests, or performance evaluations.

## How to Use

- Use vignettes during prototype walkthrough interviews or scenario discussions.
- Ask participants to narrate what they think is happening and what they would do next.
- Probe interpretations of pressure, judgement, trust, and conflict risk.
- Avoid asking for what people should do. Ask what the system makes them feel and infer.

## Vignette 1: Wrong-Household Action

Setup:
A Member belongs to two Households. They switch Households earlier in the day.

Prompt:
They add an Item, then realize it appears in the other Household.

Questions:
- What do you think happened?
- What would you feel in this moment?
- What would you need to recover safely without blame?
- What should the system make visible to reduce future risk?

## Vignette 2: Irreversible Completion Fear

Setup:
A Member taps Complete Item on an Item and it disappears from the active list.

Prompt:
Another Member asks, “Where did it go?”

Questions:
- Does this feel like deletion or like reversible progress?
- What wording would reduce conflict risk?
- What should Activity show so it stays calm and non-accusatory?
- What does a safe recovery action look like?

## Vignette 3: Hide Item Versus Complete Item Interpretation

Setup:
A Member uses Hide Item on an Item that is not needed anymore.

Prompt:
A different Member later searches for the Item and cannot find it in the active list.

Questions:
- How do you interpret Hide Item compared with Complete Item?
- What would you assume about intent?
- What would reduce the chance of “who did this” arguments?

## Vignette 4: Handoff Item As High-Stakes Probe

Setup:
A Household uses a Handoff Item for an appointment or pickup.

Prompt:
The Item is marked as Handoff, with an optional For field and a Type.

Questions:
- What does Handoff signal to you?
- Does For feel like assignment or like context?
- What details feel helpful versus policing?
- Where is the boundary between clarity and pressure?

## Vignette 5: Handoff Policing Risk

Setup:
A Handoff Item includes precise time and detailed instruction text.

Prompt:
One Member later references the detail line as evidence of what should have happened.

Questions:
- What cues made this feel like compliance?
- What microcopy or constraints would reduce evidence value?
- What details should be encouraged or discouraged?

## Vignette 6: Activity As Record, Not Performance Feed

Setup:
Activity shows recent actions: Added, Completed, Hid, Showed Again.

Prompt:
A Member scrolls Activity during a tense moment and looks for who did what.

Questions:
- Does Activity feel calm or like monitoring?
- What parts feel safe and what parts feel risky?
- What would make Activity drift into judgement even without scores?

## Vignette 7: Identity Exposure After Exit

Setup:
A Member leaves a Household. Past Activity entries exist.

Prompt:
The Household opens Activity and sees references to a Former Member.

Questions:
- What should remain visible for comprehension?
- What identity detail should be hidden by default?
- When does history become unsafe?

## Vignette 8: Hearts As Gratitude Without Status

Setup:
A Member wants to express appreciation for an Item.

Prompt:
Hearts exist, but they are not a feed mechanic and are not shown as counts by default.

Questions:
- Does the lack of visible counts reduce pressure or reduce warmth?
- Would a Hearts surface ever feel like comparison?
- What prevents gratitude from becoming obligation?

## Vignette 9: Save Progress Versus Create Account

Setup:
On Entry, a Member sees Continue As Guest and Save Progress.

Prompt:
They hesitate, wondering if sign-in is required.

Questions:
- What does Save Progress communicate to you?
- Does it feel low pressure or like a conversion push?
- What framing preserves emotional safety while still being clear?

## Closing Prompts

- What parts of this system feel like help versus management?
- What cues increase pressure without being explicit?
- Where would you expect conflict to happen, and what would a safe repair look like?
