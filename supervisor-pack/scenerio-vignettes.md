# Scenario Vignettes

## Purpose

These vignettes are prompts for qualitative, interpretive discussion. They are designed to surface how participants interpret system cues, where breakdown occurs, and what repair feels safe.

They are not benchmarks, tests, or performance evaluations.

## How to Use

- Use vignettes during interpretive walkthrough interviews or scenario discussions.
- Ask participants to narrate what they think is happening and what they would do next.
- Probe interpretations of pressure, judgement, trust, and conflict risk.
- Avoid “what people should do” questions. Ask what the system cues make them expect, feel, or infer.

## Vignette 1: Wrong-Household Action

Setup:
A Member belongs to two Households. They switched Households earlier in the day.

Prompt:
They add an Item, then realize it appears in the other Household.

Questions:
- What do you think happened?
- What would you feel in this moment?
- What would you need to recover safely without blame?
- What would you want the system to make visible to reduce future wrong-Household risk?

## Vignette 2: Irreversible Completion Fear

Setup:
A Member taps Complete Item on an Item and it disappears from the active list.

Prompt:
Another Member asks, “Where did it go?”

Questions:
- Does this feel like deletion or like reversible progress?
- What wording would reduce conflict risk?
- What would feel helpful for Activity to show while staying calm and non-accusatory?
- What does a safe recovery action look like?

## Vignette 3: Hide Item Versus Complete Item Interpretation

Setup:
A Member uses Hide Item on an Item that is not needed anymore.

Prompt:
A different Member later searches for the Item and cannot find it in the active list.

Questions:
- How do you interpret Hide Item compared with Complete Item?
- What would you assume about intent?
- What would reduce the chance of “who did this” arguments?

## Vignette 4: Handoff Item as High-Stakes Probe

Setup:
A Household uses a Handoff Item for an appointment or pickup.

Prompt:
The Item is marked as Handoff, with an optional For field and a Type. The Activity feed shows only the event line and an optional Handoff chip. Details appear on demand in a read-only context view.

Questions:
- What does Handoff signal to you?
- Does For feel like assignment or like context?
- Which details feel helpful versus policing?
- Where is the boundary between clarity and pressure for you?

## Vignette 5: Handoff Policing Risk

Setup:
A Handoff Item includes precise time and detailed instruction text.

Prompt:
One Member later references the detail line as evidence of what was expected.

Questions:
- What cues made this feel like compliance?
- What constraints would reduce evidence value while keeping enough context to coordinate?
- Which details feel safe to include, and which feel likely to create conflict?

## Vignette 6: Activity as Record, not Performance Feed

Setup:
Activity shows recent actions: Added, Completed, Hid, Showed Again. Activity may show actor display names for active Members as attribution only, and it does not provide per-person views, counts, sorting, grouping, or filtering.

Prompt:
A Member scrolls Activity during a tense moment and looks for who did what.

Questions:
- Does Activity feel calm or like monitoring?
- What parts feel safe and what parts feel risky?
- What would make Activity feel like judgement even without scores?
- How do you react to names being present for attribution, given there are no per-person summaries?

## Vignette 7: Identity Exposure After Exit

Setup:
A Member leaves a Household. Past Activity entries exist.

Prompt:
The Household opens Activity and sees references to a Former Member. Historical entries re-render to “Former Member” by default after membership ends.

Questions:
- What would still need to remain visible for comprehension?
- What identity detail feels unsafe to show by default?
- When does history feel protective versus harmful?

## Vignette 8: Hearts as Gratitude without Status

Setup:
A Member wants to express appreciation for an Item.

Prompt:
Hearts exist as a lightweight gratitude cue, but they are not shown as counts by default and they do not appear as Activity feed events.

Questions:
- Does the lack of visible counts reduce pressure or reduce warmth?
- Would a Hearts surface ever feel like comparison?
- What prevents gratitude from becoming obligation?

## Vignette 9: Save Progress Versus Create Account

Setup:
On Entry, a Member sees Continue as Guest and Save Progress.

Prompt:
They hesitate, wondering if sign-in is required.

Questions:
- What does Save Progress communicate to you?
- Does it feel low pressure or like a conversion push?
- What framing preserves emotional safety while still being clear?

## Closing Prompts

- What parts of this system feel like help versus management?
- What cues increase pressure without being explicit?
- Where would you expect conflict to happen, and what would a safe repair look like?
