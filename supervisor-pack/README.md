# KinCart — PhD supervisor pack

This folder contains a small set of research materials intended to support initial PhD supervision conversations.  
KinCart is a **non-commercial HCI/CSCW research artefact**, not a product or service.

## What you can review

**Suggested reading order (≈10 minutes):**
1) Research contribution (1 page) — conceptual framing and contribution
2) Short prototype walkthrough video (3–5 min, unlisted) — interaction constraints in context
3) Figma prototype — click-through interaction context (view-only access)

**Materials:**
- Figma prototype <[Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/0BKLn5A6LTL217Wn1Vtk1u/KinCart-Hi-fi-Mock-up-Screens?node-id=484-6085&t=1YxIJJ2rhqY7Rphx-1)> (click-through, view-only; used in interpretive walkthrough interviews)
- Short walkthrough video (3–5 min, unlisted; illustrates interaction constraints and breakdown handling)
- Research contribution one-pager: `./research-contribution-1pager.md`

## What is being studied

Household coordination breakdowns where **interface-level visibility cues** are interpreted as pressure, increasing emotional load, conflict risk, and trust fragility in shared living contexts.

The focus is not task completion or efficiency, but how people interpret coordination signals during everyday breakdown and repair.

---

## Why this matters

Many coordination systems prioritise completion, accountability, and optimisation. In domestic contexts, these design choices can unintentionally introduce judgement, surveillance, or enforcement cues that increase emotional load and interpersonal tension.

KinCart explores an alternative constraint: **preserve emotional safety while keeping shared intent visible**, and studies how this changes interpretation, trust, and willingness to engage.

---

## What exists today (research materials)

- Locked domain language and invariants used to constrain interpretation and prevent judgement drift
- Prototype materials demonstrating failure-aware interaction contracts (e.g., reversible completion, explicit household boundaries, system-owned identity)
- Decision discipline that prevents silent drift in public research artefacts while avoiding implementation disclosure

These materials support interpretive study; they are not presented as empirical findings.

## What I’m seeking

PhD supervision aligned with **HCI / CSCW research** on:
- coordination and collaboration
- domestic and everyday computing
- shared-access systems
- values-aware and safety-aware interaction design

I am open to refining research questions and methods within a supervisor’s thematic scope.

## Ethics and positioning

KinCart is maintained as a **research-only artefact**.  
It avoids enforcement, scoring, attribution pressure, and surveillance cues by design, with explicit attention to exit safety and identity protection in shared household contexts.
