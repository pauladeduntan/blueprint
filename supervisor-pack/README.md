# KinCart — PhD supervisor pack

## What you can review
- Figma prototype (link)
- 3–5 minute click-through video (link)
- Research contribution one-pager: ./research-contribution-1pager.md

## What I’m studying
Household coordination breakdowns where “visibility” becomes pressure and increases emotional load.

## Why this matters
Most coordination tools optimize completion and accountability; KinCart explores the opposite constraint: preserve emotional safety while keeping shared intent visible.

## What is already produced
- Locked domain language + invariants
- Failure-aware interaction contracts (prototype)
- Governance approach that prevents silent drift

## What I’m seeking
A supervisor aligned with HCI/CSCW/UbiComp themes: coordination, domestic computing, collaborative systems, personal informatics, and values-aware design.
