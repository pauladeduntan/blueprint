# Study Plan - KinCart (Research Probe)

## Purpose

This study examines how Household coordination systems can make shared intent visible without introducing enforcement, surveillance, or emotional pressure. KinCart is used as a **research probe** to surface how people interpret coordination cues during breakdown and repair, particularly in **High-Stakes Handoff** situations where mistakes are socially costly, rather than to optimise task completion.

## Research Questions (Illustrative)

- How do coordination cues (language, visibility, reversibility) shape perceived pressure, trust, and safety in **High-Stakes Household Handoffs** (for example, appointments, care-adjacent tasks)?
- How does the presence of a Handoff Item amplify breakdown and blame risk, and which constraints prevent visibility from drifting into enforcement under those conditions?
- How do system-owned representations of responsibility and identity affect interpretation and repair when Handoff coordination fails or when membership changes occur?

## Participants

- 6 to 10 multi-adult Households (2 to 4 adults per Household).
- Diverse living arrangements (partners, friends, extended family).
- Recruitment via personal networks and opt-in referrals; no public recruitment at this stage.

## Study Design

A qualitative, interpretive study using short engagements rather than longitudinal observation or surveillance.

### Methods

1) **Prototype Walkthrough Interviews**
   - Participants walk through everyday coordination scenarios using the KinCart prototype, with emphasis on **High-Stakes Handoff** scenarios where responsibility and timing matter.
   - Focus on interpretation rather than task success (for example, “What does this feel like?”, “What would you infer here?”, “Where would pressure arise?”).

2) **Scenario-Based Discussion**
   - Pre-written breakdown vignettes centred on High-Stakes Handoff Items (for example, wrong-Household action involving an appointment, accidental completion of a care-adjacent Item, Member exit during an active Handoff).
   - Used to probe expectations, perceived blame, repair strategies, and emotional safety under pressure.

3) **Optional Short Diary Prompts (One Week)**
   - Lightweight reflective prompts about real coordination breakdowns participants encounter, with optional focus on Handoff-related moments.
   - No in-app monitoring; diary entries are participant-authored only.

## Data Collected

- Session audio recordings (where consented) and derived transcripts or notes.
- Researcher notes from walkthroughs and discussions.
- Optional diary text entries (if used).

Identifiable materials (consent forms, contact details, raw recordings, and full transcripts) are stored outside any public repository under appropriate access controls.

### Explicit Exclusions

- No continuous or background activity logging.
- No per-person metrics, contribution counts, or responsibility scoring.
- No behavioural nudges, reminders, or urgency mechanisms.

## Analysis Approach

- Interpretive qualitative analysis (for example, reflexive thematic analysis) focused on:
  - perceived pressure versus clarity,
  - breakdown and repair moments in High-Stakes Handoff coordination,
  - interpretation of system-owned language, visibility, and reversibility cues.
- Coding is oriented toward failure modes and emotional safety, not efficiency, compliance, or performance.

## Ethics and Risk Mitigation

- Participation is voluntary with informed consent.
- Data minimisation: only study-relevant data are collected.
- Identity safety: reporting does not require attribution of actions to specific individuals.
- Exit safety: participants can withdraw at any time; no irreversible records are created.
- The prototype avoids surveillance cues by design (no reminders, no scoring, no enforcement), with particular care taken around High-Stakes Handoff Items.
- Activity posture: Activity is a read-only record, not a performance feed or notification centre. It does not support per-person views, counts, sorting, grouping, or filtering, and identity is system-owned with dynamic redaction to “Former Member” after membership ends.

## Anticipated Outputs

- A refined set of research questions grounded in empirical interpretation of High-Stakes coordination.
- Qualitative findings suitable for CSCW and HCI venues, subject to study outcomes.
- Design implications articulated as constraints and interaction principles, not prescriptions or best practices.

## Scope Note

This study is exploratory and research-only. It is designed to establish feasibility and theoretical grounding around **Handoff as a pressure-amplifying coordination surface**, not to produce generalisable claims or deploy a system in the wild.
