# Study Plan — KinCart (Research Probe)

## Purpose
This study examines how household coordination systems can make shared intent visible without introducing enforcement, surveillance, or emotional pressure. KinCart is used as a **research probe** to surface how people interpret coordination cues during breakdown and repair, rather than to optimise task completion.

---

## Research Questions (Illustrative)
- How do coordination cues (language, visibility, reversibility) shape perceived pressure, trust, and safety in **high-stakes household handoffs** (e.g., appointments, care-related tasks)?
- How does the presence of a handoff increase breakdown risk, and which constraints prevent visibility from drifting into blame or enforcement under those conditions?
- How do system-owned representations of responsibility and identity affect interpretation and repair when handoff coordination fails or membership changes occur?

---

## Participants
- 6–10 multi-adult households (2–4 adults per household).
- Diverse living arrangements (partners, friends, extended family).
- Recruitment via personal networks and opt-in referrals; no public recruitment at this stage.

---

## Study Design
A qualitative, interpretive study using short engagements rather than longitudinal surveillance.

### Methods
1. **Prototype Ialkthrough interviews**
   - Participants walk through coordination scenarios using the KinCart prototype.
   - Focus on interpretation, not task success (“What does this feel like?”, “What would you infer here?”).

2. **Scenario-based Discussion**
   - Pre-written breakdown vignettes (e.g., wrong-household action, accidental completion, member exit).
   - Used to probe expectations, perceived blame, and repair strategies.

3. **Optional Short Diary Prompts (1 week)**
   - Lightweight reflective prompts about real coordination breakdowns.
   - No in-app monitoring; diary entries are participant-authored only.

---

## Data Collected
- Interview audio recordings and transcripts.
- Researcher notes from walkthroughs and discussions.
- Optional diary text entries (if used).

**Explicit Exclusions**
- No continuous activity logging.
- No per-person metrics or contribution counts.
- No behavioural scoring, reminders, or nudges.

---

## Analysis Approach
- Thematic qualitative analysis focused on:
  - perceived pressure vs clarity,
  - breakdown and repair moments,
  - interpretation of system-owned language and reversibility cues.
- Coding oriented toward failure modes and emotional safety, not efficiency or compliance.

---

## Ethics and Risk Mitigation
- Participation is voluntary with informed consent.
- Data minimisation: only study-relevant data collected.
- Identity safety: no requirement to attribute actions to specific individuals in reporting.
- Exit safety: participants can withdraw at any time; no irreversible records created.
- The prototype avoids surveillance cues by design (no reminders, no scoring, no enforcement).

---

## Outputs
- A refined set of research questions grounded in empirical interpretation.
- Qualitative findings suitable for CSCW/HCI venues.
- Design implications framed as constraints and interaction principles, not prescriptions.

## Scope Note
This study is exploratory and research-only. It is designed to establish feasibility and theoretical grounding, not to produce generalisable claims or deploy a system in the wild.
