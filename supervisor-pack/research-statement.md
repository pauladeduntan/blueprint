**Research Statement — PhD in HCI / CSCW**

**1. Research problem and motivation**

Many everyday coordination systems rely on digital artefacts to make shared intent visible, reduce ambiguity, and help people align their actions. In domestic and shared-living contexts, however, these same systems often produce unintended social side effects. Features meant to increase clarity, such as reminders, completion states, attribution cues, or activity feeds can gradually shift coordination from shared awareness into perceived enforcement, judgement, or surveillance. When that happens, emotional load increases, interpersonal tension rises, and trust becomes fragile, especially in settings where coordination is shared but authority is informal or absent.

My research examines how people interpret these coordination cues in everyday household settings. I am interested in how seemingly neutral interface decisions come to feel pressuring, conflict-inducing, or discouraging, and how people respond when coordination tools begin to feel like they are “managing” them. Rather than framing these outcomes as usability problems or adoption failures, I treat them as interpretive breakdowns that emerge when coordination artefacts drift away from supporting shared intent.

Households provide a particularly revealing site for studying these dynamics. Roles are negotiated rather than assigned, mistakes are socially costly, and disengagement or exit carries real relational consequences. Studying coordination in domestic settings allows me to examine breakdown, repair, and trust without the formal hierarchies or enforcement structures that often obscure these processes in organisational environments.


**2. Research contribution**

This work contributes to HCI and CSCW by developing a constraint-first approach to coordination system design, centred on preserving emotional safety while maintaining visibility. Instead of optimising for task completion or accountability, constraints are treated as research instruments that shape how coordination cues are read, felt, and acted upon.

A central contribution is the idea of repairable coordination. Coordination actions are designed to be reversible, legible, and non-punitive, so that everyday mistakes do not escalate into blame or conflict. By foregrounding reversibility, system-owned language, and non-destructive state changes, the research examines how people recover from breakdowns and how trust is sustained after missteps.

A second contribution focuses on domain language as an interactional safety mechanism. System-owned labels and neutral phrasing, such as “completed,” “save progress,” or “former member” are treated not as copy choices, but as coordination cues that actively shape how judgement, responsibility, and legitimacy are perceived.

Finally, the work advances a failure-aware perspective on coordination artefacts. High-risk moments, such as wrong-context actions, membership changes, or visibility after exit are designed to be visible and interpretable, rather than hidden or optimised away. These moments become central sites for understanding breakdown and repair.


**3. Empirical strategy and methodological orientation**

Methodologically, I adopt an interpretive, qualitative approach consistent with CSCW traditions. Research prototypes are used as empirical probes rather than evaluation targets. Their purpose is not to measure efficiency or success, but to surface how people make sense of coordination cues during everyday use, breakdown, and repair.

Planned methods include prototype walkthrough interviews focused on interpretation rather than task performance, short diary studies that capture lived coordination breakdowns, and scenario-based discussions that explore alternative design constraints. Analysis is oriented toward how participants read system signals, when visibility turns into pressure, and how trust is negotiated following mistakes.

Equally important are the things the system explicitly refuses to do. The absence of reminders, scoring, or attribution pressure is treated as part of the research design itself. These refusals make alternative coordination logics visible and analytically meaningful.


**4. Research trajectory and fit**

While household coordination is the initial empirical focus, the broader research trajectory concerns shared-access systems and everyday coordination contexts where authority is weak, participation is voluntary, and relational safety matters. These questions extend to other CSCW domains, including shared digital artefacts, family technologies, collaborative tools, and values-aware interaction design.

HCI and CSCW provide the appropriate intellectual home for this work because of their emphasis on situated use, interpretive analysis, and the social consequences of interface decisions. I am seeking doctoral supervision in an environment that values domestic and everyday computing, coordination and collaboration research, and ethical, safety-aware design.

I view this research as an evolving programme rather than a fixed project, and I am open to refining research questions and methods in dialogue with supervisors while preserving a core commitment to non-coercive, emotionally safe coordination systems.
