KinCart is a mobile-first household coordination system designed to reduce mental load and preserve emotional safety through shared visibility, calm defaults, and system-owned language. It is not a task manager, accounting tool, or enforcement mechanism; it prioritises shared intent over control and reversibility over pressure. This repository contains the frozen product blueprint, domain language, invariants, and reference appendices used to lock the MVP and guide implementation.
