# KinCart — blueprint (research artefacts)

KinCart is a mobile-first household coordination system designed to reduce mental load and preserve emotional safety through shared visibility, calm defaults, and system-owned language. It is not a task manager, accounting tool, or enforcement mechanism.

## What this repository contains
- A frozen research blueprint: domain language, invariants, and narrative system flows.
- Reference appendices used to keep the prototype coherent and failure-aware.

## What is intentionally not published
Implementation mechanics are intentionally not included in this public repository (e.g., schema/RLS/RPC specifics, operational scripts, “how to build” steps). This is a non-commercial research record, not a delivery tracker.

## Core files
- `domain-language.md`
- `invariants.md`
- `product-definition.md`
- `system-flows.md`
