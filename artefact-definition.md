# Artefact Definition

KinCart is a household coordination research artefact that studies **visibility-to-enforcement drift**: how shared intent can be made visible without turning Members into managers of each other.

## Checksum (Locked)

Making every day lighter, together.

## What KinCart is

- A Shared Cart for a Household where Items reflect shared intent without urgency cues.
- An Activity record that makes actions visible without becoming a performance feed or a notification centre. Activity must not support per-person views, counts, sorting, grouping, filtering, or any other performance-like interpretation.
- A system-owned language layer that avoids blame, judgement, and enforcement framing, and bounds attribution pressure through system-owned identity rules (including dynamic redaction to “Former Member” after membership ends).
- A reversible coordination surface: actions are designed to be recoverable (including “Complete Item” as reversible hiding from the active list).

## What KinCart is not (Locked)

- Not a task manager.
- Not an accounting or settlement system.
- Not a behavioural enforcement tool.
- Not a reminder, nudge, or compliance system.

## High-Stakes Coordination Probe (Handoff Item)

KinCart includes **Handoff Items** as a **High-Stakes** coordination stress surface to study breakdown, repair, trust, and emotional safety in situations where misinterpretation can amplify relational harm (blame amplification, surveillance interpretation, identity exposure after exit, wrong-boundary actions). High-Stakes does not justify urgency, reminders, or enforcement cues. Prototype materials are used as probes for interpretive inquiry, not findings.

## Prototype Intent (Current)

The prototype is designed so Members can interpret what is happening in their Household Shared Cart, contribute safely, and rely on visible, reversible actions rather than silent or irreversible outcomes.
