# Artefact Definition

KinCart is a household coordination research artefact that makes shared intent visible without turning people into managers of each other.

## Checksum (LOCKED)
Making every day lighter, together.

## What KinCart is
- A calm shared space for household lists and progress visibility.
- A coordination layer that reduces surprises and emotional friction.
- A system where language avoids blame, urgency, or enforcement.

## What KinCart is not (LOCKED)
- Not a task manager.
- Not an accounting or settlement system.
- Not a behavioural enforcement tool.

## Study outcome (current prototype)
Participants can see what is happening in their household list, contribute safely, and trust that actions are visible and reversible rather than silently disappearing.
