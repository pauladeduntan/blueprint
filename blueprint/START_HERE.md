# START HERE

KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact exploring how household coordination can reduce mental load while preserving emotional safety.

## Fast path (5 minutes)
1) **Prototype evidence**
   - Figma: <PASTE_FIGMA_LINK>
   - Walkthrough video (2–3 min): <PASTE_VIDEO_LINK>

2) **Research contribution (1 page)**
   - See: `appendix/research-contribution.md`

3) **Core constraints (what must remain true)**
   - Domain language: `domain-language.md`
   - Invariants: `invariants.md`

4) **System narrative (what the prototype is demonstrating)**
   - `system-flows.md`

## What this repo contains
- Frozen domain language + invariants that constrain design choices.
- Narrative system flows that describe user-facing behavior and failure modes.
- A small appendix of public-safe research notes (no implementation recipes).

## What is intentionally NOT published
- Implementation mechanics (schema/RLS/RPC specifics, operational scripts, deploy steps).
- Any “copy/paste” backend recipes.

Those details are available for supervisor review under private sharing if needed.
