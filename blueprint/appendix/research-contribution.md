## Working title
Emotionally safe household coordination: making shared intent visible without enforcement.

## Problem
Household coordination tools often import workplace logics (nudges, reminders, scorekeeping). In shared homes, those mechanics can increase pressure, conflict, and emotional load—especially under ambiguity or uneven capacity.

## Claim
A coordination system can reduce mental load without becoming an enforcement mechanism by:
1) making **shared intent** visible,
2) using **system-owned language** to avoid blame,
3) building in **reversibility** to prevent “I ruined it” moments, and
4) treating membership and exit as **safety contracts**, not UI states.

## Research questions (draft)
RQ1: How do households interpret “shared intent visibility” compared with conventional task/accountability framing?  
RQ2: Which coordination breakdowns (e.g., wrong context, stale context, ambiguous completion) produce the highest emotional harm, and what design mitigations reduce it?  
RQ3: How does system-owned language affect perceived judgment, pressure, and trust during everyday coordination?

## Method plan (draft)
- **Qualitative (core):** diary + lightweight interviews over 2–4 weeks with households using a prototype walkthrough + scenarios.
- **Scenario-based evaluation:** structured vignettes that test breakdowns (wrong-household action, irreversible completion, identity exposure after exit).
- **Iterative design probes:** revise language + interaction contracts and re-test.

## Expected contribution
- A language + interaction contract for emotionally safe coordination (non-enforcement).
- A failure-mode taxonomy for household coordination breakdowns and mitigations.
- Design implications for CSCW/HCI: visibility without judgment, reversibility as safety, system-owned identity in shared logs.

## Ethics / safety considerations
- Avoid mechanisms that create interpersonal monitoring or performance pressure.
- Limit identity exposure in shared history when membership ends.
- Use study framing that does not encourage coercion or “compliance” dynamics.
