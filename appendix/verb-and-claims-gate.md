# Verb and Claims Gate (Public-Safe)

This gate prevents accidental drift into intervention, optimisation, or outcome claims. KinCart is a research artefact and probe instance, not a product claim.

## Allowed Claim Verbs (Use These)

- Characterizes
- Traces
- Maps
- Examines
- Surfaces
- Explicates
- Theorizes
- Articulates Constraints

## Avoid in Public Text (High Drift Risk)

- Prevents
- Ensures

## How to Apply (Quick Check)

Before committing public text, verify:

1) No sentence claims outcomes (mental load is a checksum/aim, not a result).
2) “Households” are the primary site; other contexts are analogues only.
3) KinCart is described as a probe instance for studying visibility-to-enforcement drift.
4) Handoff Item is framed as a High-Stakes methodological stress surface, not a feature.
