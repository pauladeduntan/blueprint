## Invariants (LOCKED)

These rules are non-negotiable. Any change requires explicit founder approval.

• Emotional safety over optimization  
• Visibility over reminders  
• Coordination over control  
• System absorbs judgement, not people  
• Sequence complexity; do not front-load it  
• Clean endings matter  

### Explicit Non-Goals

KinCart will not become:
• A task manager  
• An accountability or enforcement system  
• A productivity optimiser  
• A financial accounting or settlement tool  
• A reminder-first or notification-driven app  

### Product Checksum

“Making every day lighter, together.”

Any feature, interaction, or system behaviour that increases cognitive, emotional, or social load fails the checksum and must not ship.
