## Product Definition

KinCart is a mobile-first household coordination platform designed to reduce mental load in shared living, caregiving, and event-planning contexts. KinCart is not a task manager, shopping list app, or project tool.

Its core value lies in making shared responsibility visible, time-bound, and emotionally safe. KinCart sits between traditional list apps and household finance tools. Where list apps focus on items and finance tools focus on money, KinCart focuses on coordination, making shared intent visible without enforcement or accounting.
