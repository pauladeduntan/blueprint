# Start Here

KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact used to study **visibility-to-enforcement drift** in household coordination: how shared intent is made visible without turning Members into managers of each other. “Making every day lighter, together” is a checksum that constrains design choices, not a reported outcome. Prototype materials are research materials used as probes for interpretive inquiry, not findings.

## Fast Path

1) **Research Artefact (Used in Study)**
   - Figma Prototype (Used in Interpretive Walkthrough Interviews): [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/0BKLn5A6LTL217Wn1Vtk1u/KinCart-Hi-fi-Mock-up-Screens?node-id=484-6085&t=1YxIJJ2rhqY7Rphx-1)
   - Short Walkthrough Video (2 to 3 min, unlisted): shared on request for supervisor and reviewer fit assessment

2) **Research Contribution and Safety Notes**
   - Research Contribution (One Page): `appendix/research-contribution.md`
   - Risk Register (Research Process + Participant/Data Risks): `appendix/riskregister.md`
   - Failure-mode Tests (Public-safe, System-level): `appendix/failuremode.md`

3) **Core Constraints (What must Remain True)**
   - Domain Language (Locked): `domain-language.md`
   - Invariants (Locked): `invariants.md`

4) **Interaction Narrative (What is being Studied)**
   - `system-flows.md` describes user-facing behavior as an interaction narrative for interpretive inquiry.
   - Handoff Item is treated as a high-stakes coordination stress surface used to study breakdown, repair, trust, and emotional safety.
   - Activity is a calm, read-only record that must not become a performance feed. Identity display is system-owned with dynamic redaction to “Former Member” after membership ends.

## What this Repo Contains

- Locked domain language and invariants that constrain design choices.
- Narrative system flows describing user-facing behavior.
- A small appendix of research notes curated for public review (no implementation recipes).

## What is Intentionally not Published

- Implementation mechanics that would enable cloning (for example, backend internals and operational steps).
- Any copy/paste backend recipes or build instructions.

These details are intentionally excluded to preserve KinCart’s role as a research probe rather than a build guide.
