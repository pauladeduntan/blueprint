# START HERE

KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact used to study how household coordination can reduce mental load while preserving emotional safety.

## Fast path (5 minutes)
1) 1) **Research artefact (used as probe)**
   - Figma prototype (for interpretation walkthroughs): <[FIGMA_LINK](https://www.figma.com/proto/0BKLn5A6LTL217Wn1Vtk1u/KinCart-Hi-fi-Mock-up-Screens?node-id=484-6085&t=1YxIJJ2rhqY7Rphx-1)>
   - Short walkthrough video (2–3 min, unlisted): <PASTE_VIDEO_LINK>

2) **Research contribution (1 page)**
   - See: `appendix/research-contribution.md`

3) **Core constraints (what must remain true)**
   - Domain language: `domain-language.md`
   - Invariants: `invariants.md`

4) 4) **Interaction narrative (what is being studied)**
   - `system-flows.md`

## What this repo contains
- Frozen domain language + invariants that constrain design choices.
- Narrative system flows that describe user-facing behavior and failure modes.
- A small appendix of public-safe research notes (no implementation recipes).

## What is intentionally NOT published
- Implementation mechanics (schema/RLS/RPC specifics, operational scripts, deploy steps).
- Any “copy/paste” backend recipes.

These details are intentionally excluded from the public record to preserve the artefact’s role as a research probe rather than a build recipe.
