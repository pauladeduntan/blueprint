# Start Here

KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact used to study how household coordination can make every day lighter, together. It focuses on reducing mental load while preserving emotional safety.

## Fast Path

1) **Research artefact (used in study)**
   - Figma prototype (used in interpretive walkthrough interviews): <[FIGMA_LINK](https://www.figma.com/proto/0BKLn5A6LTL217Wn1Vtk1u/KinCart-Hi-fi-Mock-up-Screens?node-id=484-6085&t=1YxIJJ2rhqY7Rphx-1)>
   - Short walkthrough video (2–3 min, unlisted): Available on request

2) **Research Contribution**
   - See: `appendix/research-contribution.md`

3) **Core Constraints (what must remain true)**
   - Domain language (locked): `domain-language.md`
   - Invariants (locked): `invariants.md`

4) **Interaction Narrative (what is being studied)**
   - `system-flows.md` describes user-facing behavior and failure modes. It includes **Handoff item** as a **high-stakes** coordination stress surface used to study breakdown, repair, trust, and emotional safety.

## What this Repo Contains

- Locked domain language and invariants that constrain design choices.
- Narrative system flows describing user-facing behavior and failure modes.
- A small appendix of research notes curated for public review (no implementation recipes).

## What is Intentionally Not Published

- Implementation mechanics (schema/RLS/RPC specifics, operational scripts, deploy steps).
- Any copy/paste backend recipes or build instructions.

These details are intentionally excluded to preserve KinCart’s role as a research probe rather than a build guide.
