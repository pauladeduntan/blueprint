## System Flows (Narrative-Level)

### Multi-Household Context

A user may belong to up to five households. Only one household is active at any time. Users must explicitly switch context via the Household Gate to prevent cognitive bleed and accidental actions.

### Default Cart Flow (MVP)

• Household created  
• System creates default household cart  
• Items added collaboratively  
• Completion is visible  
• Activity reflects progress  

### Someone Completes Your Item

• Completion is visible  
• Attribution is shown  
• No enforcement or scoring occurs  

### Event Flows (Illustrative, Post-MVP)

Event flows are provided as illustrative examples only. Event Cart 1.0 is explicitly post-MVP and unlocked only after success signals are met.
