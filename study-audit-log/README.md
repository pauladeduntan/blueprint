# Study Audit Log (Research-Only)

This folder contains a de-identified template for tracking research activities (interpretive walkthrough interviews, interviews, vignette sessions, and diary check-ins).

## Privacy Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Do not store names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, workplace or school names, or any directly identifying notes.
- Use participant IDs only (for example, P001).
- Do not store consent forms, contact details, raw recordings, or raw transcripts in this public repository.
- Avoid including unique incidents or verbatim quotes that could re-identify a participant.
- Store any identifiable materials outside this public repository under appropriate access controls.

## What this Log is for

- Traceability: when a session happened, what artefact version was used, and what research prompts or materials were used.
- Research rigor: a minimal, de-identified record suitable for supervisor review and methodological transparency.
- Interpretive analysis support: a guide to what was discussed without scoring, ranking, or evaluating participants.

## What this Log is not

- A growth dashboard, retention tracker, or commercialization metric sheet.
- A performance record about participants or household dynamics.
